## Project Overview: Diving Deep into Shark Attacks

**Introduction**

This project delves into the fascinating world of shark attacks, aiming to uncover patterns, identify risk factors, and offer insights for enhancing safety measures. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset spanning multiple years, we've meticulously analyzed shark attack incidents to understand the underlying factors influencing these encounters.

**Key Objectives:**

* **Unraveling Trends:** Explore temporal and spatial patterns to identify hotspots and seasonal variations.
* **Identifying Risk Factors:** Investigate environmental conditions, human behavior, and other factors that may contribute to attacks.
* **Developing Safety Strategies:** Offer evidence-based recommendations to minimize the risk of shark encounters and mitigate potential injuries.

Through rigorous data analysis, we've uncovered valuable insights that can inform public safety initiatives and promote responsible ocean recreation. This project serves as a testament to the power of data-driven approaches in understanding complex natural phenomena and informing practical solutions.
## Data Source
This data was compiled and provided by Quantum Analytics in the project phase in partial fullfilment of the Data Analyst Track Certification

## Tools
** Microsoft Excel was used for Data Cleaning and Validation
** Power BI for Visualization

## Data Preparation and Cleaning

**Data Import and Inspection:**

* The dataset was initially loaded into Microsoft Excel for a comprehensive review.
* Missing values, spelling errors, and inconsistencies in data types were carefully identified.

**Data Cleaning and Transformation:**

* Misspellings were corrected and species were grouped into broader categories for analysis.
* Conditional formatting was applied in Power Query to visually highlight age bands.
* Date and time data were standardized for accurate analysis.
* Text analysis techniques were employed to extract relevant information from the injury descriptions.

These steps ensured data quality and consistency, laying the foundation for subsequent data exploration and analysis.
